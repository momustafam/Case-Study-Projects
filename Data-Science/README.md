## Projects Overview

- <strong> Automatidata (case study) </strong>: The purpose of the project is helping the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) _ a fictional company _ to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride by transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions.

- <strong> Cyclistic (case study) </strong>: This project analyzes the usage patterns of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, in order to better understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. The goal is to use these insights to design a new marketing strategy that will convert more casual riders into annual members.

- <strong> IBM Data Analyst </strong>: I applied various Data Analytics skills and techniques that I have learned as part of the previous courses in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. In this project, I assumed that I am an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organization and was presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets.  

- <strong> TikTok (case study) </strong>: Work with the TikTok data team for developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.
