Welcome to the data science directory. Here you can see some of my projects in data science also you can see <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mohammedmustafa648" target="_blank"> my Kaggle profile  </a>.

## Projects Overview

- <strong> TikTok (case study) </strong>: Work with the TikTok data team for developing a machine learning model for classifying claims made in videos submitted to the platform.

- <strong> Waze (case study) </strong>: Work with the Waze data team to develop a machine learning model to predict user churn. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using the app. This project focuses on monthly user churn. An accurate model will help prevent churn, improve user retention, and grow Waze’s business.

- <strong> Automatidata (case study) </strong>: The purpose of the project is helping the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) _ a fictional company _ to develop an app that enables TLC riders to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride by transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions.

- <strong> Cyclistic (case study) </strong>: This project analyzes the usage patterns of Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago, in order to better understand how casual riders and annual members use the service differently. The goal is to use these insights to design a new marketing strategy that will convert more casual riders into annual members.

- <strong> IBM Data Analyst </strong>: I applied various Data Analytics skills and techniques that I have learned as part of the previous courses in the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. In this project, I assumed that I am an Associate Data Analyst who has recently joined the organization and was presented with a business challenge that requires data analysis to be performed on real-world datasets.
