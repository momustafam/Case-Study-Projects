<a id="introduction"></a>
# Introdutcion
In this project, I am trying to apply my skills in data science and machine learning by developing a machine learning model classifying claims made in videos submitted to the TikTok platform and generate valuable insights from their unused data.

<a id="project_scenario"></a>
# Project Scenario
As a data analyst on TikTok's data team, TikTok is the leading destination for short-form mobile video. The platform is built to help imaginations thrive. TikTok's mission is to create a place for inclusive, joyful, and authentic content–where people can safely discover, create, and connect.

### With new considerations from the leadership team, I will be responsible for:
- Creating a project proposal by assigning the required data analytical tasks into realistic milestones.
- Preparing the data for the process of exploratory data analysis.

### Data team roles
- Willow Jaffey- Data Science Lead
- Rosie Mae Bradshaw- Data Science Manager
- Orion Rainier- Data Scientist

### Cross-functional team members
- Mary Joanna Rodgers- Project Management Officer
- Margery Adebowale- Finance Lead, Americas
- Maika Abadi- Operations Lead

# Project Stages
<a id="project_proposal"></a>
## Project Proposal ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/TikTok/1_project_proposal))
In the first stage of the project I received emails from Mr.Rosie Mae Bradshaw and my teammate Orion Rainier to know what the project tasks are and after I knew I assigned them into milestones using PACE strategy.

### About PACE Strategy
- The planning stage is where we conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project.
- The analyzing stage is where we will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.
- The construction stage is where we will build models that will allow us access to hidden relationships locked within data.
- The execution stage is where we will present the findings of our analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.



<a id="understand_the_data"></a>
## Understand The Data ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/TikTok/2_understand_the_data))
This stage aims to investigate and understand the data provided, construct a data frame in Python, perform a cursory inspection of the provided dataset, and inform TikTok data team members of your findings.

### Approach
1. Review the data dictionary
2. Download the data and build a dataframe
3. Identify the variables
4. Assess quality of the data using standard data quality dimensions
     - Uniqueness: Recorded that are Duplicated 
     - Consistency: Values Free from Contradiction
     - Relavency: Data Items with Value Meta-data
     - Validity: Data Containing Allowable Values
     - Completeness: Null values
5. Select the two most important variables for training our model (requested from my team)
6. Share an executive summary with my team

<a id="cleaning_and_eda"></a>
## Cleaning and EDA ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/TikTok/3_EDA))
In this stage, I will conduct exploratory data analysis on data for the claims classification project. I’ll also use Tableau to create visuals for an executive summary to help non-technical stakeholders engage and interact with the data.

### Approach
1. Imports, links, and loading
2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
3. Data Visualization
4. Results and Evaluation

<a id="hypothesis_testing"></a>
## Hypothesis Testing ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Data-Science/TikTok/4_hypothesis_testing))
In this stage I demostrate knowledge of how to prepare, create, and analyze A/B tests. My A/B test results should aim to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.

### Approach
1. Imports and data loading
2. Conduct EDA and hypothesis testing

<a id="regression_model"></a>
## Regression Model ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Data-Science/TikTok/5_regression_analysis))
In this stage, I will build a multiple linear regression model to help me estimate the linear relationship between one continuous dependent variable (verified_status) and two or more independent variables and then evaluate the model. 

### Approach
1. Checking Model Assumptions
2. Model Building and evaluation
3. Interpreting Model Results

<a id="ml_models"></a>
## Machine Learning ([Click Here](https://github.com/momustafam/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/TikTok/6_ml_models))
In this stage, The goal is to build a model that predicts whether a TikTok video presents a "claim" or presents an "opinion".

### Approach

1. Ethical considerations
2. Feature engineering
3. Models Building & Evaluation
