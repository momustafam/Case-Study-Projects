# Introduction
In this project, I am trying to apply my skills in data science by enabling New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) riders
to estimate the taxi fares in advance of their ride and generate valuable insights from their unused data.<br><br>



<a id="project_scenario"></a>
# Project Scenario
I am a newly-hired data professional at Automatidata, a fictional data consulting firm. Automatidata works with its clients to transform their unused and stored data into useful solutions, such as performance dashboards, customer-facing tools, strategic business insights, and more. They specialize in identifying a clientâ€™s business needs and utilizing their data to meet those business needs. 

In this scenario, I will consult with The New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission to develop an app that will help users (TLC riders) estimate their taxi fares before their ride.

### My responsibilities in the project:
- Structure the necessary tasks into a project proposal that establishes milestones for the ride fare data project.
- Analyze, identify key variables, and prepare New York City TLC data for exploratory data analysis.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis on New York City TLC data and use Tableau to create visuals for an executive summary.

### Automatidata Team Members:
- Udo Bankole, Director of Data Analysis
- Deshawn Washington, Data Analysis Manager
- Luana Rodriquez, Senior Data Analyst
- Uli King, Senior Project Manager

### New York City TLC Team Members:
- Juliana Soto, Finance and Administration Department Head
- Titus Nelson, Operations Manager

# Project Stages
<a id="project_proposal"></a>
## Project Proposal ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/Automatidata/project_proposal))
In the first stage of the project I extracted the project tasks from Automatidata leadership team meeting and used Plan, Analyze, Construct, and Execute (PACE) strategy
for deviding the tasks into a project proposal.

### About PACE Strategy
- The planning stage is where we conceptualize the scope of the project and develop the steps that will guide you through the process of completing a project.
- The analyzing stage is where we will collect, prepare, and analyze all of the data for your project.
- The construction stage is where we will build models that will allow us access to hidden relationships locked within data.
- The execution stage is where we will present the findings of our analysis, receive feedback, and make revisions as necessary.

## Understand The Data ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/Automatidata/understand_the_data))
In the second stage of the project I will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. This project uses a dataset called 2017_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv. It contains data gathered by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission. For each trip, there are many different data variables gathered.

### Approach
1. Review the data dictionary
2. Download the data and build a dataframe
3. Identify the variables
4. Assess quality of the data using standard data quality dimensions
     - Uniqueness: Recorded that are Duplicated 
     - Consistency: Values Free from Contradiction
     - Currency: Values up to Date
     - Relavency: Data Items with Value Meta-data
     - Validity: Data Containing Allowable Values
     - Completeness: Null values
5. Select the two most important variables for training our model (requested from my team)
6. Share an executive summary with my team

## Cleaning and EDA ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/tree/main/Data-Science/Automatidata/EDA))
In this stage, I will examine data provided and prepare it for analysis. I will also design a professional data visualization that tells a story, and help data-driven decisions for business needs.

### Approach
1. Imports, links, and loading
2. Data Exploration and Cleaning
3. Data Visualization
4. Results and Evaluation

<a id="hypothesis_testing"></a>
## Hypothesis Testing ([Click Here](https://github.com/mohammed112025/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Data-Science/Automatidata/hypothesis_testing.ipynb))
In this stage I demostrate knowledge of how to prepare, create, and analyze A/B tests. My A/B test results should aim to find ways to generate more revenue for taxi cab drivers.

### Approach
1. Imports and data loading
2. Conduct EDA and hypothesis testing
